WikiAuthBot#1556 (625962497165230080) privacy policy & data usage statement.

WikiAuthBot (WAB) collects certain data in order to provide OAuth authentication between Discord and Wikimedia (or Miraheze) accounts.

Upon authenticating, WAB will reach out to the language relevant wikimedia API, and create a session for the user to log into with only the mwoauth-authonly grant (defined as 'User identity verification only, no ability to read pages or act on a user's behalf.'), returning this link to the user.
A successful login via that session will result in WAB being sent tokens from Wikimedia. WAB uses these tokens to get the username of a user, then drops the tokens from memory.

Some servers have opted in to [[linking]] of messages to thier corresponding wikimedia pages. Essentially the same function as WikiBot#4311 (334801258722492416). 

WAB stores authenticated usernames, discord IDs, server IDs, user-set language region, and channel IDs that have been setup as notification channels.

WAB does not store messages, user tokens, user groups, block logs, images, IPs, channel names or any other content.
Some of these may be pulled in conducting normal processes, but they are not commited to file.

For users wanting to opt-out of authentication, they can run the command .nauth in any shared server, and their wikimedia username to discord ID relationship will be removed from WAB's database.

WAB is hosted and stores all it's data on Toolforge, other than the creator (User:IVORK / IVORK#0001 140902977618706432), Wikimedia Staff and approved volunteers also have access to the database by nature
of them administering the Toolforge environment, for a full list, see https://openstack-browser.toolforge.org/project/tools.
